bots do not have a player.name causing other mods to break
--> what do you mean?

Events:Subscribe("Player:TeamChange", function(player, team, squad)
		if player == nil then
		print("player has no name")
		else
        print("Welcome ".. player.name)
		end
    end)

Events:Subscribe("Player:Killed", function(player, inflictor, position, weapon, isRoadKill, isHeadShot, wasVictimInReviveState, info)
        if inflictor == nil then
            print(player.name .. " was killed by magic")
	else
	print(inflictor.name .. " killed " .. player.name)
        end
end)

Opinons:
i need a team function please if not already so from ui can pick which team they spawn to.
--> There are the following options:
    - If you pass a player to the botspawn:
        Config.spawnInSameTeam
    - without a Player (nil)
        Config.botTeam
